    "Description": "Count of non-zero voxels in dilated brain mask.",

    "Description": "Count of non-zero voxels in the facemask.",
    "Notes": "One of afni_refacer's intermediate files named tmp.05.sh_t2a_thr.nii contains two brain mri volumes. The 2nd volume is a grayscale image/scan of the participant's face, which was extracted and binarized to generate the facemask."

    "Description": "Count of non-zero voxels in overlapping region between the facemask and dilated brain mask.",
    "Expected Value": "Zero",
    "Reason for expected value": "Overlap between brain mask and face mask indicates that afni_refacer chopped off some of the brain along with the face. However, it could also indicate that fsl_anat's brain mask doesn't accurately map onto the participant's brain. Either way, such a participant's defacing would be considered to have failed."
